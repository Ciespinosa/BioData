The study concludes that; on current data; it is not possible to classify the two species formally; but there are strong indications that; at least locally; the populations of the two species are in decline. The causal factors appear to be a combination of high trade levels and habitat loss. It is essential that trade moratoria are implemented; pending the outcome of further research into the species' population sizes; ecology and breeding success; and further work to determine the extent of trade. Interim recommendations are given and it is proposed that future exploitation of the species should continue only when it has been determined that it has a sustainable basis.";"Conservación";"NA";"Artículo";"Ecuadorian dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Traditionally; three major taxonomic groups of continental House Wrens have been recognized: (1) aedon (Northern House-Wren); (2) brunneicollis (Brown-throated Wren); and (3) musculus (Southern House-Wren). The isozyme data were converted to genetic distances and analyzed using UPGMA; Distance Wagner; Fitch-Margoliash; ""minimum-evolution;"" and neighbor-joining algorithms. In addition; a cladistic frequency parsimony analysis (FREQPARS) was performed. All of these methods revealed that the Northern House-Wren and the Brown-throated Wren are sister taxa. There was little genetic differentiation (average Nei's D = 0.010) among the seven subspecies of the Southern House-Wren analyzed. Average genetic distances between the Southern House-Wren; the Northern House-Wren; and the Brown-throated Wren are higher than any values reported for intraspecific variation in Nearctic birds; and are comparable to levels of divergence between other Nearctic and Neotropical species. Although the current taxonomy considers the three forms members of a single species; we recommend re-elevating the three groups to species status based on the genetic differences that indicate the three are distinct evolutionary ""units."" We propose a vicariant hypothesis for the divergence of the Northern House-Wren and the Brown-throated Wren.";"Ecología";"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1369567";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

Phylogenetic relationships of genera in this lineage were investigated using cytochrome b sequence data. This study indicates that the genera Euphonia and Chlorophonia (traditionally considered part of Thraupinae) do not form a monophyletic group with the other tanagers. Within the rest of Thraupinae; several monophyletic groups are identified that agree with traditional sequential taxonomies. Other monophyletic groups provide novel interpretations of biogeographic patterns and morphological evolution within tanagers. In several lineages; plumage patterns and colors persist despite dramatic changes in bill morphology. Phylogenetic structure and estimated timings of divergence events indicate that tanagers probably originated on Caribbean islands and later diversified throughout Central and South America during the mid-Tertiary.";"Ecología";"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790397904309";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

Alternative causes of desertion such as human disturbance; predation; disease; heat; and food shortage did not fit the evidence.

In normal years; the combined populations of the three species showed an 18 % increase per year. El Niño occurred at approximately five-year intervals and caused a population decrease of 17 % and 35 % desertion of nesting areas. In severe El Niño at approximately 12-year intervals; there was a mean decrease of 4 7 % and complete nesting failure. El Niño varied in severity and a possible explanation is presented. In non-El Niño years; commercial fishing did not directly control bird populations through starvation of adults or drowning in nets. Increased commercial fishing apparently led to decreased nesting success."" The greater the quantity offish landed; the lower the percentage increase of the bird population that year. Short-lived; heavily-fished species such as anchoveta are in constant danger of population collapse during years of occasional; unpredictable reproductive failure. Bird populations could be maintained as buffers to prevent terminally-destructive overfishing by humans.";"Ecología";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320783900757";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

The combined populations of these three species increased from 8 to 20 million birds. The annual rate of increase of the population rose from 8 to 18%. The three species appear to have evolved in the face of a shortage of nesting space. They have not diverged in their respective breeding seasons E. ach species has habitat preferences for nesting; but the overlap is great. The booby and cormorant compete through a ""scramble"" to occupy space before it is settled by the other species. Neither can displace the other from nest sites. The pelican is dominant over the other two in aggressive interactions and frequently usurps their nests. Pelicans are apparently confined to nesting in level areas; whereas the other two species can nest on a greater range of gradients.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1093/auk/100.3.680";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

This species has greatly diminished from its former abundance. The coast of Peru is characterised by high biological productivity which concentrates fish such as the anchovy Engraulis ringens; the main prey item of marine predators including seabirds. In years of the abnormal oceanographic conditions of El Nino; the schools of anchovies become unavailable to the seabirds and they disperse in search of food. Massive mortality; especially of juveniles; results and there is nest desertion and lack of reproduction. This paper describes the effects of the 1982-83 El Nino on Humboldt penguin colonies in Peru. There has been an overall population decline of 65 % and the surviving population in 1984 was estimated to be between 2100 and 3000 adults. Although El Nino is a periodic event and the Humboldt penguin has evolved to adapt to such unpredictable changes; the environment has now been altered by man. Under these circumstances; the 1982-83 El Nino has contributed to placing this species in a critical position.";"Ecología";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320786900054";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

During this period; changing oceanographic conditions affected prey availability: 1996 was cold and 1997-1998 was an El Niño event. The three species showed different responses to changes in the surrounding marine environment. Peruvian Boobies fed exclusively on Peruvian anchovies (Engraulis ringens) during both 1996 and 1997 and were not present on the island in 1998. Blue-footed and Masked boobies fed extensively on this prey during 1996; less so in 1997; and no anchovies were found in their diet in 1998. In 1997-1998; Blue-footed Boobies switched to coastal fishes other than anchovies; and Masked Boobies fed almost exclusively on oceanic prey species. Changes in regurgitate mass and mean number of prey items in regurgitates were also observed. Results suggest that the abundance and availability of fish prey species; mainly Peruvian anchovies; determines thresholds at which boo- by species change foraging strategies to avoid possible competition for less available resources.";"Ecología";"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4641115";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

The largest remaining tracts of forest in this region are in the Bosque Nacional de Tumbes; Peru. This forest; which was visited in 1986 and 1988; holds significant populations of 12 threatened or near-threatened species; and smaller populations of at least three more endangered species. Six species (Aramides axillaris; Thalurania colombica; Picumnus olivaceus; Attila torridus; Arremonops conirostris; Carduelis siemiradzkii) are reported in Peru for the first time. Evidence is presented for seasonal movements of some species; including the threatened Leptotila ochraceiventris and in the small Peruvian population of Pionus chalcopterus.

Nucleotide diversity within populations was similar to that reported for other species of passerines and did not differ markedly between mainland and island populations. Thus; founder effects and population bottlenecks associated with island colonization appear to have caused little; if any; loss of mtDNA nucleotide diversity. No significant mtDNA differentiation was observed between populations of named subspecies on mainland Panama (S. a. isthmicus) and the Pearl Islands (speratus); or between two subspecies in the Lesser Antilles (albicollis and guadelupensis). Saltator albicollis exhibits marked geographical genetic differentiation; as assayed by mtDNA polymorphism; but this bears little relationship to subspecies distinctions.

Six of these condors were raised by their parents then held with other juveniles in large aviaries before being shipped to Peru. They were between 1 and 3 years old when released. The other 5 condors were hand reared with the aid of puppets that closely resembled adult condors. They were released at the age when natural fledging occurred. Over periods of 170-260 days we taught these released birds how to forage by placing carcasses at progressively greater distances from the release site until the birds' foraging area was large enough that they encountered natural carcasses more frequently than those we offered. At this point they rapidly became independent of our care. The 6 birds released at an older age integrated with the wild population more rapidly than did the 5 birds released at fledging age; however; we had better control over the behavior and movements of the fledging- age birds. Seven of the 11 birds successfully reached independence and survived >18 months after their release.";"Manejo";"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3801266";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

For at least four years prior to the 1982-1983 El Niño; nearly all adult condors in a coastal population and an Andean foothill population refrained from breeding; whereas condors in a high-elevation population appeared to be breeding once every other year. The severe environmental disruptions of the 1982-1983 El Niño caused the food supply for the coastal population of condors to decrease; while the food supply for the foothill population increased 17 fold. The food supply for the high-elevation population was little affected by El Niño because climatic changes in the area were inconsequential. In response to the increase in food; almost all condors in the foothill population bred in the months following El Niño. No condors in the coastal population bred after El Niño; and breeding of condors in the high-elevation population was presumably unaffected. If they can reproduce only during the unpredictable El Niño years; coastal and foothill condor populations may barely be able to maintain their numbers without ingress from more regularly breeding populations. The rate of breeding in these desert-dwelling condors seems to be the lowest recorded among birds.";"Ecología";"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2388187";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

In the study reported here we evaluated the taxonomic status of these taxa and discussed key features involved in speciation. All three taxa exhibited multiple differences in plumage; morphology; and vocalizations; supporting the recognition of three species in Rhynchospiza. The very large-billed R. stolzmanni has a song composed of a succession of faster complex trilled phrases; shows a small black loral line and dark-chestnut head stripes with large dark central-stripe to individual feathers; and is resident in the Tumbes region. The large and heavy dabbenei has a song consisting of a series of simple chirping notes; shows a large black loral crescent and chestnut head stripes with a reduced to absent dark center to feathers; and inhabits the Austral Yungas as a year-round resident. The small and pale strigiceps has a song consisting of a succession of complex trilled phrases; shows a small black loral line and rufous-brown head stripes with large dark central-stripe to feathers; and inhabits Dry and Sierran Chaco where it is a partial migrant. Locality data and ecological niche modeling show that dabbenei and strigiceps are allo-parapatric and use different altitudinally segregated habitats at their zone of parapatry. Molecular phylogenetic analyses (NADH dehydrogenase 2 [ND2] gene) revealed R. stolzmanni to be sister (11.5% divergent) to a recently diverged dabbenei and strigiceps clade (1.6% divergent). We conclude that the genus Rhynchospiza comprises three species-level entities; each restricted to a major biogeographic region; and that vocalizations and facial patterns provide key evidence on species limits in these otherwise similarly plumaged taxa. The evolutionary–cultural differences in songs; with complex phrases in those of R. strigiceps and R. stolzmanni; and single notes in the songs of R. dabbenei; suggest changes in the innate vocal learning template during speciation in the latter.";"Distribución";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01695-2";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

This study was conducted at Chaparri Ecological Preserve; in the critically endangered Tumbesian ecosystem on the western slope of the Andes. Field observations show that this bird is a frugivore; Cordia lutea (Boraginaceae) was the primary fruit consumed of the eight species of seeds collected from droppings. Collected seeds were sown in pots under nursery conditions and monitored for germination. Germination rates of passed seeds for Cordia lutea were compared to those that had been collected from a control group of trees. Germination was significantly different between fecal and control seeds; suggesting the plant germinated better after passing through the guans alimentary tract. The identification of flower structures; and digested seeds in feces show that guans can be effective fruit and flower predators. This study provides further information regarding the diet for conservation of the white-winged guan and suggests the bird may aid seed germination in some instances and may act as a predator in others.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2013.836720";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

However; population genetic structure may be challenging to detect in species with large population sizes; since variation in allele frequencies are more robust under genetic drift. High gene flow among populations; that can be constant or pulses of migration in a short period; may also decrease power of algorithms to detect genetic structure. Penguin species usually have large population sizes; high migratory ability but philopatric behavior; and recent investigations debate the existence of subtle population structure for some species not detected before. Previous study on Humboldt penguins found lack of population genetic structure for colonies of Punta San Juan and from South Chile. Here; we used mtDNA and nuclear markers (10 microsatellites and RAG1 intron) to evaluate population structure for 11 main breeding colonies of Humboldt penguins; covering the whole spatial distribution of this species. Although mtDNA failed to detect population structure; microsatellite loci and nuclear intron detected population structure along its latitudinal distribution. Microsatellite showed significant Rst values between most of pairwise locations (44 of 56 locations; Rst = 0.003 to 0.081) and 86% of individuals were assigned to their sampled colony; suggesting philopatry. STRUCTURE detected three main genetic clusters according to geographical locations: i) Peru; ii) North of Chile; and iii) Central-South of Chile. The Humboldt penguin shows signal population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM); suggesting that the genetic structure of the species is a result of population dynamics and foraging colder water upwelling that favor gene flow and phylopatric rate. Our findings thus highlight that variable markers and wide sampling along the species distribution are crucial to better understand genetic population structure in animals with high dispersal ability.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215293";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

This study aims to: (1) identify patterns in variation of abundance across sites; (2) examine congruence of abundance hotspots across species and spatial autocorrelation of abundance within species; and (3) assess the nature and strength of environmental correlates of abundance (topography; habitat and human pressure). Location: Twenty-six sites across the full ranges of 14 dry forest bird species in northern Peru. Methods: Study sites in this patchy habitat were selected within strata derived from species distribution models; while also ensuring geographic representation. Species abundance data from variable-width transects were compared across sites and across range core versus edge; relationships between abundance and environmental variables were examined using GAMs; and spatial autocorrelation was examined with multivariate Mantel tests. Results: Although most species were recorded at most sites; local abundance varied by one or two orders of magnitude. Several species showed a humped rather than the classic skewed abundance distribution; with abundance not necessarily highest at the center of specie’s ranges. Spatial autocorrelation in species? local abundance was evident only at distances less than 55 km. Sites of maximum abundance for individual species did not coincide-nine different sites held highest densities of at least one species. Relationships between local abundance and almost all environmental correlates were non-linear. Main conclusions: The extreme variation in species abundances and the complexity in their relationships with environmental variables have important implications; both for design of conservation-motivated surveys for which we offer some recommendations; and for the need for multiple reserves to capture high local abundances of key species.";"Distribución";"https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12577";"Artículo";"Northern Andean páramo";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

Due to the frequency of observations obtained; we suggest the possibility of the existence of at least one additional breeding colony in the north and one in the central coast of Peru. On the other hand; because of the continued loss of nesting areas by guano harvesting activity; we propose the establishment of intangible islands and points where guano extraction must be banned with the aim of providing P. garnotiimore areas suitable for breeding and growing.";"Conservación";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Estimates of total numbers in South America; put at c. 25;000 birds; have been rather imprecise due to lack of data and likely over estimate the actual numbers. The species has been declining and contracting its range in South America since the 1970s. A review of the current distribution and status of Southern Pochard in South America suggests a major decline throughout most of its range; particularly in the Andes; Caribbean coast and Pacific lowlands; with no recent confirmed records from most of Colombia and Peru and dramatically reduced numbers in Ecuador. It is declining in Venezuela and numbers in Argentina have always been low. In Brazil the species is still numerous in Ceará south to Bahia and Goiás states; but apparently declining. Hunting and habitat loss from siltation; dredging and destruction of riparian vegetation appear to be the major threats. We estimate that the current maximum numbers are of 10;000 Southern Pochard in South America (although potentially as few as 5;000); making it necessary to update and revise the conservation status of this South American subspecies.";"Distribución";"NA";"Artículo";"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

Although most research has focused on methods of improving the accuracy of bird counts; few studies have evaluated the impacts of these methods on bird behavior. In this study; we examined the effects of the DJI Phantom 3 drone approach (altitude; horizontal and vertical descent speeds) on changes in the intensity of behavioral response of guano birds: guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvilli); Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata) and Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus). The breeding and non-breeding condition was also evaluated. Methods: Eleven locations along the Peruvian coast were visited in 2016–2017.Droneflight tests considered an altitude range from 5 to 80 m from the colony level; a horizontal speed range from 0.5 to 15 m/s; and a vertical descent speed range from0.5 to 3 m/s. The intensity of the behavioral response of birds was scored and categorized as: 0-no reacting; 1-head pointing to the drone (HP); 2-wing flapping (WF); 3-walking/running (WR) and 4-taking-off/flying (TK). Drone noise at specific altitudes was recorded with a sound meter close to the colony to discriminate visual from auditory effects of the drone. Results: In 74% of all test flights (N= 507); guano birds did not react to the presence of the drone; whereas in the remaining flights; birds showed a sign of discomfort: HP (47.7%; N= 130); WF (18.5%); WR (16.9%) and TK (16.9%). For the drone approach tests; only flight altitude had a significant effect in the intensity of the behavioral response of guano birds (intensity behavioral response <2). No birds reacted at drone altitudes above 50 m from the colony. Birds; for all species either in breeding or non-breeding condition; reacted more often at altitudes of 5 and 10 m. Chick-rearing cormorants and pelicans were less sensitive than their non-breeding counterparts in the range of 5–30 m of drone altitude; but boobies reacted similarly irrespective of their condition. At 5 m above the colony; cormorants were more sensitive to the drone presence than the other two species. Horizontal and vertical flights at different speeds had negligible effects (intensity behavioral response <1). At 2 m above the ground; the noise of the cormorant colony was in average 71.34 ± 4.05 dB (N= 420). No significant differences were observed in the drone noise at different flight altitudes because the background noise of the colony was as loud as the drone. Conclusions: It is feasible to use the drone DJI Phantom 3 for surveys on the guano islands of Peru. We recommend performing drone flights at altitudes greater than50 m from guano bird colonies and to select take-off spots far from gulls. Likewise; this study provides a first step to develop guidelines and protocols of drone use for other potential activities on the Peruvian guano islands and headlands such as surveys of other seabirds and pinnipeds; filming and surveillance.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

Here we compare these organizational effects of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest within days of hatching; while blue-footed booby neonates lack lethal aggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively up regulate testosterone (T) during fights; motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies; providing comparative evidence of the role of androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates; exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term organizational effects on behavior or morphology. Adult Nazca boobies show evidence of organizational effects of early androgen exposure in aberrant adult behavior: they visit unattended non-familial chicks in the colony and direct mixtures of aggression; affiliative; and sexual behavior toward them. In a longitudinal analysis; we found that the most active Non-parental Adult Visitors (NAVs) were those with a history of siblicidal behavior as a neonate; suggesting that the tendency to show social interest in chicks is programmed; in part; by the high perinatal androgens associated with obligate siblicide. Data from closely related blue-footed boobies provide comparative support for this interpretation. Lacking obligate siblicide; they hatch with a corresponding low androgen level; and blue-footed booby adults show a much lower frequency of NAV behavior and a lower probability of behaving aggressively during NAV interactions. This species difference in adult social behavior appears to have roots in both pleiotropic and experiential effects of nestling social system";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

The Neotropics sustain the highest passerine diversity on Earth; but little is known about this region’s historical biogeography based on fossils. To assess how passerine species were affected by Quaternary climate fluctuations; we identified 625 late Pleistocene fossils (individual fossilized bones) from the now arid and faunally depauperate Talara Tar Seeps in northwestern Peru.  Of the 21 passerine species identified; only 2likely live at the site now; the remaining 19 species require more mesic conditions.  Species identified included members of the Thamnophilidae (antbirds); Melanopareiidae (crescentchests); Tyrannidae (flycatchers); Hirundinidae(swallows); Mimidae (mockingbirds); Thraupidae (seedeaters; ‘‘finches’’); Emberizidae (sparrows); and Icteridae(blackbirds). Nearly half of the individual fossils and 8 of the 21 species were icterids; including 3 extinct species (1previously described; 2 new). The late Pleistocene passerine community at Talara; which was nonanalog to any modern community; suggests that the site once supported savanna; grasslands; and forests during the last glacial interval; which are absent near Talara today.

Penguin numbers along the southern and central coast of Peru (97% of the total) did not differ significantly between 1999 and 2000; the average number was 4;425 individuals. In1999; the proportion of juveniles (one-year-old birds) was only 0.2% compared with 7% in 2000; probably as a result of the 1997-98 El Niño. Penguins were found from La Foca Island (5°12’S) to Punta Coles (17°42’S). However; the majority (78%) were clustered in five localities; Punta San Juan (36%); San Juanito Islet (11%); Hornillos Island (10%); Pachacamac Island (12%) and Tres Puertas (9%).  The size and distribution of penguin colonies have changed over the last 15 years. Penguins have abandoned sites at Punta Corio; Sombrerillo and Morro Sama; and have decreased significantly in numbers in Punta San Fernando and Punta La Chira; where human disturbance has increased; mainly due to local fisheries activities. Penguins have increased at Punta San Juan; San Juanito Islet and San Gallan Island; all of which are partially protected. Half of the penguins were located in guano bird reserves; primarily at Punta San Juan. Guano bird reserves provide some protection against terrestrial predators and human disturbance; however; periodical guano extraction decreases their breeding success. Most penguin sites were found in inaccessible and marginal areas; which were vulnerable to occasional and unpredictable flooding from ocean swells. The methodology recommended by the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for a consistent census of penguins in Peru and Chile during the molting period was validated at the Punta San Juan Reserve. Continued monitoring of Humboldt Penguin numbers is recommended in order to more fully understand patterns of fluctuation and to be able to detect changes of conservation concern as early as possible. Collaborative efforts between local authorities and conservation biologists are needed to monitor and protect this vulnerable species.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Yet; our understanding of the proximate environmental cues driving seasonal breeding is limited. This is particularly the case in marine ecosystems; where key environmental factors and prey abundance and availability are seldom quantified. The Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is a highly productive; low-latitude ecosystem of moderate seasonality. In this ecosystem; three tropical seabird species (the Guanay Cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvillii; the Peruvian Booby Sula variegata; and the Peruvian Pelican Pelecanus thagus) live in sympatry and prey almost exclusively on anchovy; Engraulis ringens. From January 2003 to December 2012; we monitored 31 breeding sites along the Peruvian coast to investigate the breeding cycle of these species. We tested for relationships between breeding timing; oceanographic conditions; and prey availability using occupancy models. We found that all three seabird species exhibited seasonal breeding patterns; with marked interspecific differences. Whereas breeding mainly started during the austral winter/early spring and ended in summer/early fall; this pattern was stronger in boobies and pelicans than in cormorants. Breeding onset mainly occurred when upwelling was intense but ecosystem productivity was below its annual maxima; and when anchovy were less available and in poor physiological condition. Conversely; the abundance and availability of anchovy improved during chick rearing and peaked around the time of fledging. These results suggest that breeding timing is adjusted so that fledging may occur under optimal environmental conditions; rather than being constrained by nutritional requirements during egg laying. Adjusting breeding time so that fledglings meet optimal conditions at independence is unique compared with other upwelling ecosystems and could be explained by the relatively high abundances of anchovy occurring throughout the year in the NHCS.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Between May and December2008 and 2009; raptors were surveyed along transects; and associated habitat data collected in 70 randomly allocated 1-km2plots.  Ten habitat variables were selected for modelling.  Spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of species was measured through Moran’s I and later habitat models were ranked using Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). The most important variables that influenced the presence of species included the percentage of vegetation cover at different strata and elevation. The presence of the tree species; ceibo (Ceiba trichistrandra) and guasima (Guazuma ulmifolia); were also important. The percentage of vegetation cover from 5–15 m appeared in all models for Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura); Crane Hawk (Geranospiza caerulescens); Great Black Hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga); and Harris’s Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus). These findings suggest that vertical structure of forested areas is of particular importance for raptors at the study site; including those of conservation concern.

Cattle grazing was widespread and intensity was negatively correlated with average canopy height and percentage of vegetation cover at 5–15 m. Raptors were influenced by cattle density but they were probably more strongly influenced by canopy and sub-canopy characteristics. Raptor species responded differently to increasing cattle density: presence of species that hunted or searched for food in open habitats increased with cattle density; while presence of range restricted species that hunted from perches; and declining species decreased. Moderate cattle densities (20–60 cows km-2) may actually benefit some raptor species and help to maintain the high raptor diversity in the study area. Reserve authorities should; however; act to reduce cattle densities in some areas; which can exceed 120 cows km-2; that seriously affect some key raptor species; and cause forest to be converted to permanent cattle pasture.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-013-0616-z";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

Although there is well-documented variation of offspring sex ratios in several bird species according to maternal condition; the assumption that maternal condition has different fitness consequences for male and for female offspring remains unclear.  The blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) is a sexually size-dimorphic seabird; with females approximately 31% heavier than males.  It has been reported that the sex ratio is male biased in years with poor feeding conditions; which suggests that either females adjust their sex ratio in accordance with their condition or that they suffer differential brood mortality before their sex can be determined. In this study I tested whether the condition of mothers affected their daughters’ fitness more than their sons’ fitness.  I manipulated maternal investment by trimming the flight feathers and thereby handicapping females during the chick-rearing period. Adult females in the handicapped group had a poorer physical condition at end of chick growth; as measured by mass and by the residuals of mass on wing length compared to control birds. Female chicks were affected by the handicapping experiment; showing a lower mass and shorter wing length (reduced approximately 8% in both measures) than controls. However; this effect was not found in male chicks. Hatching sex ratios were also related to female body condition at hatching. The brood sex ratio of females in poor condition was male biased but was female biased for females in good condition. Overall; these results suggest that the variation in the sex ratio in blue-footed boobies is an adaptive response to the disadvantage daughters face from being reared under poor conditions.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

There is much debate about whether seabirds have a <U+FB01>xed or <U+FB02>exible level of investment in their current reproduction; and it has been proposed that parents can regulate the risk of an increase in mortality under the control of a mass threshold. Body mass change as response to experimental manipulations of parental effort was examined in blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii Mine-Edwards); a sexually size-dimorphic seabird; with females approximately 31% heavier than males. First; paternal effort was manipulated by trimming the <U+FB02>ight feathers and thereby handicapping males during the chick-rearing period. Mass remained stable in handi-capped males; while there was a reduction of female body mass as response to the handi-capped partner.

Secondly; an experiment was made by enlarging and decreasing broods of two chicks to three and one during the <U+FB01>rst week after hatching. Body mass of females; but not males; was lower in enlarged broods; and body mass of males; but not females; was higher in the reduced broods when the chicks were 45 days old.

Climate variability such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has impacted this species and other marine fauna in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. After reviewing manuscripts and reports; we identified 80 Humboldt Penguin breeding colonies; distributed from La Foca Island (05°12'S; 81°12'W) in Peru to Metalqui Island (42°12'S; 74°09'W) in Chile; but reduced the number to 73 after fieldwork surveys in northern Chile.

The  Humboldt  Penguin  population  of  the  main  breeding colony in Peru; Punta San Juan; decreased 51% from 1980 to 2008; with notable decreases during El Niño. On the other hand; the population of Chañaral Island to the south increased 89% during the same period; which could be a result of irruption from more northern populations  as  well  as  past  underestimation.  The  SAD  does  not  follow  the  expected  unimodal  log-normal  shaped  model;  and  its  shape  has recently shifted significantly southward. This change is consistent with the species’ pattern of long distance movement during ENSO; reduced  population  genetic  structure  and  long-distance  gene  flow  between  colonies;  indicating  the  absence  of  philopatry;  a  decrease  in  population size in the main colonies in Peru and an increase in population size in colonies along northern Chile. The change in SAD might result from interactions between consecutive El Niño events; human activities and climate change. To better understand this pattern; further studies are required in population genetic structure; species physiology; and environmental variables in space and time.";"Distribución";"http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/42_2/42_2_153-159.pdf";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

We also discuss the foraging behavior of BFBs in relation to what is known about the vertical distribution of their main prey and compare the BFB’s foraging behavior with that of other tropical and temperate Sulidae. After analyzing data on 23 females and 28 males; we found no sexual differences in diet composition; crop mass; trip length; number of trips per day; proportion of time in flight and on the water; and number of dives per hour. We argue that this is because males and females were foraging in the same areas close to their colony. Conversely; females dived significantly deeper and longer; and consumed larger prey than males indicating that segregation may occur underwater. Body size (regardless of sex) was positively correlated to dive depth and prey size; suggesting that feeding niche separation is mediated by size dimorphism. However; the effects of body size and sex on foraging behavior could not be separated. BFBs and larger temperate gannets attained similar depths; but BFBs dived much deeper than did tropical boobies. The Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens was the most important prey consumed by BFBs; accounting over 79 to 97% of the total mass of the regurgitations.

BFBs preferentially moved to the east of the island and foraged over the continental shelf in cold water masses where marine productivity and the abundance of the main prey; the Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens; are usually higher than in other areas. Overall; the median maximum foraging distance from the colony was 39 km (range 3 109 km); with 90% of all trips located within30 km from the mainland; and enclosed in an area of 13;113 km2. These results reveal that BFBs exploit the productive waters of the Peruvian Coastal Upwelling System; rather than open oceanic waters as previously suggested. BFBs travelled a greater distance; dispersed in a broader area; and visited more offshore waters during the winter 2002; than during the summer 2003; following the typical seasonal horizontal dispersion of the Peruvian anchovy.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

In Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus); the evidence for nocturnal foraging is sparse and anecdotal. We used GPS-dataloggers on five incubating Peruvian pelicans from Isla Lobos de Tierra; Peru ´; to examine their nocturnality; foraging movements and activities patterns at sea. All instrumented pelicans undertook nocturnal trips during a 5–7day tracking period. Eighty-seven percent of these trips (n = 13) were strictly nocturnal; whereas the remaining occurred during the day and night. Most birds departed from the island after sunset and returned a few hours after sunrise. Birds traveled south of the island for single-day trips at a maximum range of 82.8 km. Overall; 22% of the tracking period was spent at sea; whereas the remaining time was spent on the island. In the intermediate section of the trip (between inbound and outbound commutes); birds spent 77% of the trip time in floating bouts interspersed by short flying bouts; the former being on average three times longer than the latter. Taken together; the high sinuosity of the bird’s tracks during floating bouts; the exclusively nocturnal trips of most individuals; and the fact that all birds returned to the island within a few hours after sunrise suggest that pelicans were actively feeding at night. The nocturnal foraging strategy of Peruvian pelicans may reduce food competition with the sympatric and strictly diurnal Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii); Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata) and Blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii); which were present on the island in large numbers. Likewise; plankton bioluminescence might be used by pelicans as indirect cues to locate anchovies during their upward migration at night. The foraging success of pelicans at night may be enhanced by seizing prey close to the sea surface using a sit-and-wait strategy.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Cormorants were distributed in small discrete groups (Mode = 5 birds; range 1- 69) from Isla Foca (5'12'S) to Morro Sama (18?0'S). The southern (56% of the total numbers) and central (34%) coast held a larger proportion of cormorants than did the northern region (10%). Birds were mainly located in un- protected areas; either on islands (6%) or on the mainland (51%). The remainder was found in protected areas; either guano bird islands (27%); guano bird headlands (3%) or within the Paracas Reserve (13%). We counted 658 birds (95% adults; 5% juveniles); but based on bird density; availability of suitable habitats and cliff lengths we predicted a total of 1;803 + 282 birds in Peru. Red-legged Cormorants built their nests on narrow ledges on vertical rocky walls falling sheer to the sea; located; on average; 17.8 m (range = 3-50; N = 56) above the sea level on open cliffs; high-up in sea cave entrances or on small islets. They have undergone a spectacular decline over the last 30 years. Between 1968 and 1999-2000; the numbers at ten localities in the northern and central coast decreased from 3;229 to 69 birds. It is likely that low numbers recorded in this study reflect the devastating effects of the strong El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of 1997-98; as numbers prior and after this event at eight southern localities decreased by 73%. Because of the inaccessibility of their nesting and roosting sites and the lack of natural predators; Red-legged Cormorants are apparently not in danger at such sites. However; entanglement in fishing nets; competition for food in inshore waters; pollution; human disturbance and harvesting of kelp banks are potential threats at sea and could affect the population recovery.";"Ecología";"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1522265?seq=1";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Birds used across winds and across headwinds when commuting to their feeding grounds and across tailwinds when returning to their colonies. This strategy increased flight speeds by 38–53% in relation to headwinds; probably resulting in a reduction in energy costs when birds returned to their nests with heavy loads of food. Sea surface temperature of the foraged and the available areas were similar around LT and LA. Boobies from LT fed over the continental shelf and alongshore in areas with chlorophylla (Chla) concentration higher than expected from a random distribution. Conversely; birds from LA never came inshore; feeding over the shelf break and in waters with concentrations of Chla similar to those in the available area. Remote-sensing measurements of primary productivity predicted the distribution of Peruvian boobies only for LT. Plumes of enriched water alongshore are formed during the austral summer; favouring the aggregation of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens); the main prey of Peruvian boobies. Boobies from LA may have potentially foraged inshore in an area also used by birds from LT; but it is likely that competition for food and energy constraints to raise three-chick broods restricted foraging range to waters far from the mainland.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

We evaluated whether (1) its foraging behavior differed from tropical boobies and temperate gannets (the Peruvian boobies feed in areas of enhanced productivity and high fish density); and (2) females and male sexploited different foraging habitats as a consequence of size dimorphism. Birds foraged only during daylight hours; 1 to 3 times a day; in trips of short duration (median = 1.8 h). Overall; 92% of the total foraging time was spent flying. They fed exclusively on anchovetas Engraulis ringens; which were captured in shallow dives (median = 2.5 m; max = 8.8 m) with a dive median rate of 11 dives h–1(max = 37 dives h–1). The median foraging range was 25 km (max = 68 km); whereas the median total distance traveled was 69 km (max = 179 km). Foraging site fidelity was high; and the orientation of foraging flights in any given day was similar among birds that departed at the same time. There were no sex-specific differences in 13 of 15 foraging variables; however; females dived slightly deeper and spent a larger proportion of time sitting on the water. We speculate that (1) the foraging behavior of Peruvian boobies contrasts with that of their tropical and temperate relatives as a result of the proximity and predictability of food sources; elevated energetic demands of the brood (up to 4 chicks) and high prey encounter rate in the Peruvian upwelling system; and (2) the lack of spatial segregation between sexes may be related to the attraction of birds to feeding aggregations that are formed in the vicinity of the colonies.

Wetlands can offer optimal conditions for feeding; but the cost of using them is becoming higher with a sharp increase of human expansion into coastal areas and urban development around wetlands. We identified the following threats affecting Peruvian Terns on their feeding and breeding grounds:1) recreational activities;2) off-road driving by fishermen and tourists;3) wetland pollution and water use for irrigation;4) conversion of desert plains to agricultural land;5) management of wetland water levels;6) presence of feral cats and dogs; and7) oil exploration on the desert plains.

Calls and biometry provide a fast; reliable; and inexpensive method for classifying most adult Peruvian Boobies as males or females in the field.  Were commend a hierarchical system for classification of male and female Peruvian Boobies: (1) use of vocalizations; (2) use of body weight and wing chord when the bird did not vocalize and was weighed immediately after daybreak or before the first feeding trip of the day; and (3) use of wing chord only when there is uncertainty in temporal variations of body weight.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

For both adults and immatures; wing formula and wing length are not reliable taxonomic characters because of their continuous clinal relationship. In both age classes; wing tip contour changes allometrically with changes in wing length; which is itself a function of body size and mass. Thus; neither of the currently accepted morphometric characters examined here serve to separate taxon polyosoma from taxon poecilochrous. There are at least 27 distinct adult plumage morphs (formerly five) in this species group; perhaps more than any other in Falconiformes; with no relationship to morphometric variables and only minor geographic variation. Immature plumages are similarly ineffective in diagnosing taxa. Vocalizations are similar among adults from widely varying latitudes and altitudes. I therefore propose dropping poecilochrous (Gurney 1879) in favor of polyosoma (Quoy and Gaimard 1824) for all forms in this group; as the latter has priority. The English common name applied to this group should be Variable Buzzard; with the exception of the isolated population in the Juan Femandez Archipelago which should for now remain the Juan Femandez Buzzard (B. p. exsul); although it may well be elevated to species rank with further data.";"Sistemática";"NA";"Artículo";"Ecuadorian dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Previously (Isler et al. 1998); through empirical analysis of pairs of syntopic species; we developed methods and standards for employing vocalizations in determining species limits in the family Thamnophilidae. Building on this study; we now propose procedures for integrating vocal characters with morphology and geographic distribution in making species determinations in thamnophilids. We applied this methodology to populations of antwrens in the Myrmotherula surinamensis complex (including three subspecies of M. surinamensis and M. cherriei). Four diagnostically differentiated populations were identified; all of which corresponded to named taxa. Each population (some of which are narrowly sympatric) was distinguished unambiguously by morphology and vocalizations. Under these objective and conservative standards; we recommend that Myrmotherula surinamensis; M. multostriata; M. pacifica; and M. cherriei be recognized as distinct species. The level of differentiation found between M. surinamensis and M. multostriata illustrates the minimum threshold recommended for species status of allopatric populations of thamnophilid antbirds and should provide a useful reference point for future considerations of species limits.";"Sistemática";"NA";"Artículo";"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

In a previous study; we used molecular data to demonstrate that Thryothorus is actually paraphyletic; leading us to propose its splitting into three genera (one newly described) in addition to Thryothorus. Here we show that most species within each of these four genera usually sing with the same style; and that these styles tend to differ between the genera. We also show that a few species have songs that differ markedly from those most typical of their genus.

Three endemic and endangered species; Henna-hooded Foliage-gleaner (Hylocryptus erythrocephalus); Ochre-bellied Dove (Leptotila ochraceiventris); and Gray-breasted Flycatcher (Lathrotriccus griseipectus) were found in second growth more often than in mature forest. Antbird species richness and abundance was greater in mature garúa forest; than in second growth; possibly due to differential arthropod abundance in forest litter. Seventeen bird species were only encountered in mature garúa forest and none were threatened. Among them; Bicolored Antbird (Gimnopithys leucaspis); Scaly-throated Leaftosser (Sclerurus guatemalensis); and Dagua Thrush (Turdus daguae) were easy to detect by sight or song; making them good indicator species for this type of tropical forest. Birds detected by observation and listening were similar in both forest types making trail surveys less useful than mist netting for detecting differences between bird communities in the two forest types.";"Diversidad";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

The environment and climate are outlined- a cool; dry season from about May to November and a warm; variable wet season from December to April; when alone rain may fall. It is shown that each year the general breeding season is closely correlated with the rainfall. The peak of breeding varies from year to year by at least a month and its length from about six weeks to three and a half months. Although all species for which there are enough data; are stimulated to breed after important falls of rain; most of those species of small land-birds which are completely resident; attempt to nest before the rain and often continue for some time afterwards. Some specific differences; between seed- and insect-eating finches; seem to be adaptations to food supply and the availability of nest sites and building material. Such evidence as there is suggests that raptors; waders and waterfowl also nest in the wet season (often late); rather than in the dry season. (Unfortunately herons and sea-birds do not nest in the area.) Annual differences in the amount of breeding by the same species are thought not to be entirely due to differences in weather between years. It is suggested that the late (August-September) breeding in the Galapagos Islands described by Lack (1950) and the apparent dry-season nesting of raptors; waders; and waterfowl there might be found to be linked with variable or abnormally wet weather; if records of rainfall from the islands were available.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";"Ecuadorian dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

These signs included: low flying of Peruvian Terns over the observer; terns flying around the observer; birds flying with fish in their beaks to feed their chicks and the presence of one nest with two inactive eggs in Pampa Urricape. The latter is a fact of particular importance because of this species' fidelity to the nest and/or place of nesting. Also; Pampa Urricape was the site with the largest number of individuals; with a total of 22 located. The problem of habitat loss is affecting Peruvian Tern conservation. In this regard; we observed the practice of different economic activities in the desert which are leading to its modification. Among these activities we observed sugar cane crops; chicken barns; lots for homes; and a wind farm proposal. Finally; we propose recommendations for the conservation of the Peruvian Tern such as the revaluation of the desert ecosystem; the increase of its representation within the National System of Natural Protected Areas by the State; and the development of appropriate policies that include the Integrated Management of the Marine Coastal Zone to enable the sustainable development of these areas.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";"Sechura desert";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

An association was found between the colonies of this species with the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens (Shaw; 1800) in Lobos de Afuera and Foca; with the blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii (Milne-Edwards; 1882) in Lobos de Afuera and Lobos de Tierra; the peruvian pelican Pelecanus thagus (Molina; 1782) in Lobos de Afuera; and with the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti (Meyen; 1834) in Foca. Egg predation and klepto-parasitism of S. nebouxii was common for this species in the three islands. Regarding the selection of nesting areas; it was noted that the Kelp Gull used different types of substrates such as rock; gravel; flagstone; boulders and seashells and that the nests were built using the resources of the site; mainly seaweeds and feathers and; in the Foca case; using leaves from sapote Capparis scabrida (Kunth; 1821). The nests were located in high and windy areas of the islands next to cracks and large rocks; from slopes of less than 15º to cliffs. Apparently; the timing of nest initiation was the same in the three islands; starting around the third week of October; in most cases were found three eggs in the nests.

We also found a greater record between September and November; falling sharply in December which could be related to its breeding activity. Based on historical information; the presence of P. garnotii in Peru was known from Lobos de Tierra island (Lambayeque; 06°28'S) to Islay (Arequipa; 17°01'S); in a range of 1570 km.

(2) The skulls have a nasal opening in their early stages of development; which is completely closed with the growth of the bird. The respiratory function moves to a space that is below the pre orbital fenestra and the jugal; which is protected by ranfoteca. (3) Adult individuals present a trabecular space in the inner part of the upper jaw and frontals that confers resistance to the skull.

New data available for the White-winged Guan (P. albipennis) provide insight into its phylogeny and speciation. A multivariate analysis of variance on six characters of P. purpurascens; P. jacquacu; P. perspicax; and P. obscura indicates that P. jacquacu and P. pw- purascens are significantly different from each other in six characters; and that P. perspicax and P. obscura are more similar to P. jacquacu than to P. purpurascens. Analysis of vocalizations shows that P. albipennis calls are more similar to those of P. purpurascens than to those of P. jacquacu. Three speciation models proposed for Penelope were evaluated in light of the above data.

This is the case of species local distribution; thus for many locations in the Tumbesian region an adequate systematization and information availability is still lacking. Accordingly researchers; decision makers or the general public can’t access to this information. In this paper; we present a compilation on bird richness within canton Zapotillo; located southwest of the province of Loja in southern Ecuador. Zapotillo is part of the recently declared ""Dry Forest"" Biosphere Reserve. This compilation includes information generated by different studies since 2001; and also incorporates the results of an inventory using mist nets and a collection of audible and visual records performed in 2014-2015 across nine localities in the area. We registered 156 bird species; including 43 endemic to the Tumbesian region; 23 migratory species and five globally threatened species. In addition; we propose expanding geographic distribution for four Ecuadorian bird species. Taken together our results and previous literature; the total number of birds registered for Zapotillo reaches 184 species; of which 49 are endemic to the Tumbesian region; 25 are migratory species; and 11 are globally threatened.

Despite this fact; the knowledge about avian communities is particularly deficient. A main environmental characteristic of the region is an extremely seasonal rain pattern; which leads to two highly pronounced weather seasons: wet and dry. The aim of this research was to characterize the structure and composition of the bird community during the two weather seasons in La Ceiba reserve; located in southwestern Ecuador. In nine months during the year 2003; bird censuses were performed using microtransects. A detrented correspondence analysis revealed that the bird assemblage was strongly influenced by seasonal rain; showing a gradient in the position of the months; from rainy to dry months. The wet season had a greater species richness supported by a species accumulation curve and the Chao 2 statistics; this pattern is similar to what has been found in other tropical dry forests habitats. Insectivorous and omnivorous species were more abundant in the wet season; which could be related to seasonality in food resources. Intratropical migrant bird species comprised an important component of the avian assemblage; which affects conservation planning within the Tumbesian region in that some level of habitat connectivity is required to facilitate the dispersal of birds in this severely disturbed region.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

In this paper we examine the impacts of rural community activities that are pervasive in tropical regions on mixed-species flocks of birds in a unique coastal tropical dry forest ecosystem; with the aim of advancing both our understanding of mixed-species associations and how best to conserve them. We examined the effects of small-scale clearing of trees and livestock grazing on mixed flocks in two vegetation types in the highly threatened Tumbesian region of Ecuador. Because the fitness benefits of flocking come from a reduced risk of predation or enhanced feeding efficiencies; or both; habitat degradation could lead to changes in the benefits of flocking and thus flock characteristics. We predicted that; in more disturbed vegetation; flocks would have fewer species and individuals and that species would show lower flocking propensities and feeding efficiencies. Based on observations of 431 flocks; we found that these predictions were supported in tropical dry forest but not always in arid scrub vegetation. Less disturbed tropical dry forest had greater mean species richness per flock than more disturbed tropical dry forest; but mean species richness per flock did not differ between more and less disturbed arid scrub. Flock species richness and composition differed across the disturbance levels in tropical dry forest; but not in arid scrub. Many species had their highest flocking propensities and greatest foraging efficiencies in less disturbed; compared to more disturbed; vegetation. We show that existing park management; which allows community development and lives tock grazing within national park borders; leads to degradation of the vegetation and disrupts species’ interactions in tropical dry forest. We provide specific conservation recommendations to mitigate these disruptive influences. Examining intraspecific associations across diverse communities is of the utmost importance to both answering basic theoretical questions in community ecology and conserving species diversity in the face of anthropogenic landscape change";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Species classified as Change of distribution range were mostly aquatic. Terrestrial species were mostly classified as Knowledge gap; while aquatic species were mostly classified as Accidental. Our protocol was validated using species which are known to have modified their distribution range in the Palearctic region; all of which were correctly classified by our methodology.

Ecuador is home to an important number of studies focused mainly on the identification of species involved in conflicts. However; the country's coast; particularly the southwest dry forests; has remained untouched by this topic. This study was carried out in the communities surrounding the Tumbesia La Ceiba Natural Reserve; Zapotillo canton; in southern Ecuador. Using a semi-structured interview; applied to local inhabitants; we were able to identify; categorize; and define the frequency; causes; and attitudes towards conflicts with the sector's wildlife. Six types of conflicts were identified: hunting; predation of domestic animals; destruction of crops; medicinal uses; species trafficking; and ofidiophobia. Sixteen species are involved in this problem. Puma Concolor and Lycalopex sechurae are proposed as the most conflictive species. In addition; an organized community response was identified to address the problems caused by the species; and the costs caused by wildlife attacks were found to be significant; primarily when they involved the loss of goats.

However; few investigators have attempted to track changes in the number of pairs using such roosts. We studied Red-lored Amazons (Amazona autumnalis) at a communal roost in southwest Ecuador over a 1-yr period to understand better their population structure. Population size was estimated at 214 individuals. Counts revealed seasonal variation in numbers; but the occurrence of pairs and singles was seldom correlated. The number of paired individuals using the roost was lower during the breeding period. In contrast; the number of single birds at the roost nearly doubled during the breeding period. Overall; our data suggest that parental responsibilities during the nesting period explain fluctuations in the number of birds at the roost; and such fluctuations can be used to estimate the reproductive portion of the population. Protection of the small mangrove islands where the parrots roost would likely benefit a population that occupies a much larger area and would; at the same time; provide a useful tool for demographic studies of this poorly known neotropical parrot.";"Ecología";"NA";"Artículo";"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

In this study; I analyzed the avian component of the zooarchaeological remains to examine patterns in resource use and paleoecological conditions during site occupancy. For comparison; I also identified the bird bones from three archeological sites in the Valdivia Valley; 38 km to the north. The composition of the avifauna at the El Azúcar site is highly unusual. Unlike at any other sites; including the Valdivia Village sites examined in this study; songbirds and small ground doves make up over 90% of all samples. The large number of songbirds and columbids is probably due to a combination of (1) taphonomy; (2) the use of 1/8 in. mesh for screening of sediments during excavation; and (3) local adaptations in resource use. Novel hypotheses regarding the exploitation of birds by the Guangala people of El Azúcar are presented. Most importantly; I posit that most birds were probably hunted by women and children in and around agricultural plots; perhaps by using fishing nets. The avifauna at El Azúcar and the Valdivia Village suggest that climate was variable; consistent with the expected impact of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on the Ecuadorian coast. These insights could not have been gained without the use of 1/8-in screens and species-level identifications of the zooarchaeological specimens.";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";"Ecuadorian dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

During January and February 2009; a night-lighting technique was developed for the selective capture of Peruvian Thick-knees in southwestern Ecuador; and the molt sequence and biometrics of free ranging individuals were documented for the first time. Birds were located (24 sightings) and captured (four individuals) along 48 km of unpaved roads using a lightweight LED flashlight and a 80-cm diameter hand-held net.

A. umbrinus was found in the Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri); Least Sandpiper (C. minutilla); Stilt Sandpiper (C. himantopus); Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) and Wilson’s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor); while Austromenopon sp. is presumably the first record collected from the Surfbird (Aphriza virgata). These findings indicate that the distribution of these chewing lice species covers at least the regions around the equator (latitude 0º) until the Arctic in the north; but probably also includes the entire winter distribution area of the host species.

The first known active nest for this species was located in December 2002. The nest was monitored and after a month the eggs were preyed on by a pair of A. haematopygus. We observed these types of predatory events in four more nests located in especially wooded areas of the Buenaventura Reserve. Four successful nests were located in wooded pastures. Although the number of identified nests was not representative; we believe that the nests located in wooded open areas are related to preventing preda¬tion; as is the case with other psittacids; although this hypothesis must be proven. Due to these predation events; in 2007 50 artificial nests were placed in wooded pastures; in an area of approximately 2;000 ha.

This bird occurs only in a small range in the premontane cloud forests of southwestern Ecuador. The global population size is declining rapidly due to habitat loss and is currently estimated at only 3000 mature individuals. We caught a total of 28 Ecuadorian Tapaculos in forests of varying size in an area of about 40 km². From each bird; we took morphological measurements and a blood sample. This was used to develop a set of 10 species-specific microsatellite primers for genetic analysis and we found that the Ecuadorian Tapaculos display high levels of genetic diversity. Additionally; we identified dispersal corridors for the species across the landscape using a least-cost path analysis. Notably; we found that wing shape is related to forest size. Individuals in smaller fragments show adaptations of the wing morphology to enhanced mobility and better flight capacity. Our results suggest that the Ecuadorian Tapaculo may rapidly adapt its morphology to the level of habitat fragmentation.

Moreover; ongoing climate change in the tropics drives species uphill as lower-lying areas are becoming constantly drier. Such upslope movement can pose major challenges for less mobile species; such as understorey birds which are confined to mature forests and unable to cross habitat gaps. Consequently; these species are threatened by a combination of upslope range shifts and forest fragmentation.  In our study; we investigated population numbers and habitat requirements of the Ecuadorian Tapaculo Scytalopus robbinsi; which is endemic to the premontane cloud forests of south-western Ecuador. Comparing the microhabitat structure within territories with control sites revealed that Ecuadorian Tapaculos prefer old secondary forests. Moreover; connectivity between forest fragments was the strongest predictor of the presence of territories within them. We estimated the mean upslope shift of the distribution range as 100 m per decade and developed a model of habitat availability for the revised range. Extrapolating the number of territories from the study area to the distributional range of the Ecuadorian Tapaculo showed that the global population size is smaller than previously assumed. Our results suggest that the Ecuadorian Tapaculo is strongly affected by forest loss and degradation. Therefore; to prevent a continuing decline in population numbers or even extinction; conservation measures focusing on restoring connectivity between fragments and increasing habitat quality and quantity for the remaining populations need to be prioritised.";"Ecología";"https://bit.ly/39fXZdH";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

L. labrosus lives mainly in deciduous and semi-deciduous forests; where it is restricted to wet microhabitats; and occasionally in evergreen forests. L. labrosus inhabits northern; central; and southern regions of western coastal Ecuador and northern and central western coastal Peru up to 700 m; and into the dry interandean valleys of southern Ecuador and northern Peru up to 1 300 m. Its distribution encompasses moistly seasonally dry forest in coastal Ecuador and Peru. It also occupies moister areas towards the slopes of the Andes where it is sympatric with three other congeneric species; but at sites of sympatry the species show habitat segregation. The distribution pattern of L. labrosus is shared by several other range-restricted amphibians corresponding to the Tumbesian region; which should be recognized as an endemic Amphibian area. The zone between the Choco and Tumbesian regions; where L. labrosus gets in sympatry with other Leptodactylus species; possess ecological and climatic characteristics that have shaped a unique fauna; including several endemic taxa; and it should be recognized as the west Ecuadorian endemic region";"H.Natural";"NA";"Artículo";"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

The major method of data analysis is application of the multivariate stepwise discriminant function analysis. Results of the morphological analysis are compared with known information on mating calls; larvae; and karyotypes. Based on all available data; taxonomic conclusions are drawn. The nomenclature of the group is described in detail; associating proposed names with the species units recognized in this study. Wherever possible; the original type material was re-examined for this study. Of the 19 species recognized in the fuscus group; 4 are described as new. For each species; the following information is provided: a synonymy of primary names; a diagnosis for adults; adult and larval morphological characteristic summaries; diagnostic description of the mating call; diagnostic description of the karyotype; and distribution including localities and associated specimen museum numbers for the specimens examined. A key is provided at the end of the species accounts. The composite range of the group is extensive; ranging from Texas to Argentina; on both sides of the Andes; and certain islands of the West Indies. Several characters used in the analysis are sexually dimorphic. It is postulated that sexual dimorphism in hind limb proportions is due to differential selection; the shorter male limb the result of selection for the burrowing activity of incubating chamber formation; the longer female limb the result of selection for avoiding above ground vertebrate predators. Sexual dimorphism occurring in the lip and thigh stripes of some species is explained by the hypothesis that males are using the information to discriminate among females in mate recognition. The ancestral stock of the fuscus group is presumed to have been fossorially adapted to an area with a vegetation type similar to that now found in the Gran Chaco. Evolutionary events within the species group correlate with adaptations to more mesic environments";"Sistemática";"http://www.chalk.richmond.edu/Leptodactylus/pdf/Heyer1978fuscus_1.PDF";"Artículo";"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

Data for presence/absence of 101 species of 34 genera and 10 families registered in 12 sites (nested in four biogeographic units) were obtained through fieldwork; museum collections; and literature records. We examined the influence of geographical; altitudinal; temperature; and precipitation distances on differences in anuran composition between sites. We found significant positive correlations among all of these variables with anuran distribution. The greatest alpha diversity (species richness) was found in the Equatorial Chocó biogeographic unit. Equatorial Pacific biogeographic unit could act as a transition zone between the Equatorial Chocó and Equatorial Tumbes. The western Andes (Western Cordillera biogeographic unit) was the most dissimilar and exhibited a higher species turnover rate than the other bio-geographic units.

In this context; we investigated the plastic response to pond desiccation in a neotropical species (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) by raising tadpoles in three water level treatments: constant high; constant low and decreasing. The growth rates were the highest reported for amphibian tadpoles (up to 0.3g/day) and the time to metamorphosis was short in all treatments; with the fastest developing tadpole metamorphosing in only 16 days after egg deposition. Individuals from the constant high water level treatment had a higher growth rate than those in the other two treatments; whereas decreasing and constant low water levels had similar effects on development; speeding up metamorphosis. In turn; this involved a cost as these tadpoles had a lower body size and mass at metamorphosis than the ones raised in constant high water levels.";"Diversidad";"https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/210161/2/J_Zoology_2017_Author-version.pdf";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Medopheos edracanthus is a diurnal species; with an activity pattern between 08:00 and 16:00 hours; presenting a peak of activity between 11:00 and 13:00 hours; with no differences observed between juveniles and adults. This species tends to mostly occupy the ground surface and leaf litter; selecting patches exposed to sunlight. No differences were recorded between adults and juveniles regarding the use of microhabitats; although juveniles were observed more frequently on exposed ground; which may be related to their physiology or to territorial segregation between adults and juveniles. This species presented a high body temperature (36.5 ± 0.63 °C); with no differences observed between males and females. The observed body temperature was similar to that of other species of Neotropical teiids. This lizard consumes mainly Isoptera and larvae; including sedentary and grouped prey; similar to those consumed by other species of Neotropical teiids. Medopheos edracanthus forages actively; a historical factor resulting in ecological similarities within the Teiidae family.

We surveyed this region to elucidate the distribution and conservation status of C. mache. We located it in three new localities and also found a museum specimen from a further new locality. We recommend that the species should be categorized as Critically Endangered because of the continuous and progressive destruction of its increasingly fragmented habitat. Recent surveys of glassfrog species sympatric with C. mache showed low relative abundances compared to surveys in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the relationship between forest and local climate we suggest that gradual declines of lowland glassfrog populations may be caused by local climate changes produced by forest destruction. In situ conservation is required to halt and mitigate these impacts.

However; since error rates vary between species; matching techniques; and image qualities; it is important to assess error rates to evaluate the reliability of photo-ID. We tested the performance of this method in the Pacific Horned Frog; Ceratophrys stolzmanni; a threatened anuran with a variable dorsal coloration. We compared the effectiveness of visual (i.e. human recognition) versus software-assisted recognition techniques (Wild-ID and APHIS); and assessed the potential applicability of these techniques to identify post-metamorphic individuals (froglets). The three techniques differed in their performance. The visual technique was the only one to produce type I errors between pairs of images (i.e. matching images which are not true matching pairs); however it also produced fewer type II errors (i.e. not identifying true matching pairs of images) than the software-assisted techniques. For froglets; we found that similarity scores calculated by photo-ID software did not differ significantly between groups of froglets and older individuals; supporting the idea that colour patterns in this species remain stable after metamorphosis. The lack of type I errors and the substantial reduction in required time achieved through the use of software; make software-assisted techniques (particularly Wild-ID) a valid and convenient matching technique for C. stolzmanni. We propose that photo-ID can also be applied to froglets of this species; since the pattern at this stage appears to be as variable as in adults and maintained through life.";"Ecología";"https://brill.com/view/journals/amre/aop/article-10.1163-15685381-bja10025/article-10.1163-15685381-bja10025.xml";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

The study was developed along 15 km of mangrove channels and tidal creeks; using nocturnal spotlight boat surveys during the dry season (September to December; 2004). About four crocodiles; with a relative abundance of 0.45 ind./km; ranging 0.27–0.63 ind./km; were detected. Crocodiles were aggregated in the final extreme of a tidal creek (Estero Plano Seco); where the water salinity ranged 10.0–28.0 psu and releasing of effluents (>32.0°C) from electric power plants and run-off from urbanized centers have been evidenced. Most of the crocodile sightings occurred during low tide. The population was represented only by adults (50%) and juveniles (50%); subadults and hatchlings were not observed during the study period. The population density found in this study is one of the lowest densities for American crocodile in the American regions. The euryhaline ability and tolerance to inhabit elevated surface water temperature (thermoconformer) confirm the physiological adaptation of this reptile species.

Dendrophidion brunneum is diurnal; terrestrial; heliophilic; and oviparous. It occurs in humid montane forests or mixed puna grassland/highland forest. Recorded prey are small terrestrial frogs but a large individual possibly consumed a lizard. Defensive mechanisms include a pseudautotomic tail and behaviors such as striking; biting; and neck inflation. The hemipenis has a short; narrow base; a greatly expanded distal region; and a simple; centrolineal sulcus spermaticus. The expanded region is ornamented with spines; distal to which two flounces completely encircle the organ and another extends partially around one side.

We predicted a restricted environmental suitability area from 48;509 Km2 to 65;147 Km2 along western Ecuador and adjacent Colombia; ~8% of the potential distribution occurs within SNAP. We examined four aspects of C. mache ecology: (1) ecological data suggests a strong correlation between relative abundance and rainfall; with a high probability to observe frogs through rainy months (February–May); (2) habitat use and the species distribution model suggest that this canopy dweller is restricted to small streams and rivulets in primary and old secondary forest in evergreen lowland and piedmont forest of western Ecuador; with predictions of suitability areas in adjacent southern Colombia; (3) the SNAP of Colombia and Ecuador harbor a minimum portion of the predicted model of distribution (<10%); and (4) synergetic effects of habitat loss and climate change reduces in about 95% the suitability areas for this endangered frog along its distributional range in Protected Areas. The resulting model allows the recognition of areas to undertake conservation efforts and plan future field surveys; as well as forecasting regions with high probability of C. mache occurrence in western Ecuador and southern Colombia.

This paper describes the sex ratio; length-weight relationship; gonad development; spawning season and size at reproductive maturity of P. boulengeri; inhabiting the lentic system of Chongo´n dam; Ecuador. Fish were caught between 2003 and 2009 using gill nets (2.5”). The total length (Lt) of caught specimens ranged from 10.5 to 35.5 cm; spawning occurred between the months of October and March; and size at first maturity for females was estimated at 17.9 cm (Lt) and 20.0 cm (Lt) for males. Between May and October male and female ratios were as expected (1:1); whereas for May; November and April; females ratios were higher than males; situation that coincided with the spawning season. The limnetic conditions and high production characteristics of Chongo´n dam; have promoted the avail- ability of a great amount of food for this species; which may have allowed P. boulengeri to have a more extended reproductive season in this favorable environment.

Fish have been inventoried through scientific collections in the main river basins; including coastal rivers; high Andean aquatic environments and the Peruvian Amazon. Our studies in aquatic systems in the main natural protected areas have been relatively intensive; which allows us to have a reasonable estimate of fish diversity in these areas. This paper discusses specific inventories in Peruvian coastal rivers and in the high Andes; as well as in some river systems; such as the Amazon; shared with several neighboring countries.
To date; the Scientific Collection of fishes of the Natural History Museum of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos contains approximately 450;000 specimens; in approximately 40;000 catalogued lots. Compiling this information with the pertinent scientific literature; 1064 valid native species (55 families and 17 orders) are recognized. Most of the species correspond to the Super Order Ostariophysi (82%); with Characiformes and Siluriformes as the dominant orders. Characidae is the most diverse family comprising 24% of the total number of species. The authors estimate that the number of continental species for Peru would be around 1300 species. Therefore; in order to understand the current diversity of freshwater fishes; it is necessary to carry out more field work in many large hydrographic systems and their tributaries; because some results date back two decades and in those places where accessibility is more restricted; our knowledge is still scarce.
In this publication; in addition to presenting the updated annotated list of fishes for the inland waters of our country (1064 valid species); according to systematic order and including common names and their distribution by major river basins; we discuss the conservation status of aquatic resources and their habitats for fishes in the main river basins of Peru. It also mentions the current
current problems that negatively affect the country's aquatic systems; such as deforestation and gold mining along high forest areas and the Amazonian plain; the direct environmental impacts that have been identified on aquatic systems and their species are also noted: the introduction of exotic species that affect local and regional ichthyofauna; the construction of numerous hydroelectric dams that would mainly affect the natural migration of fish and their reproductive cycles; in addition; overfishing on a regional scale (in the surroundings of large cities such as Iquitos and Pucallpa; fishing efforts have increased notably in the last decade and the catch per unit effort seems to have decreased).
Finally; some recommendations are proposed that could have an important effect on the care of aquatic ecosystems and their fish: the establishment of environmental education programs; communication to the general public about the main problems that threaten freshwater ecosystems and species; and the preparation of future corrective measures for the protection; conservation and recovery of such environments and organisms.";"Distribución";"https://bit.ly/3vPcmhV";"Libro";NA;NA;"Bosques lluviosos"

Actual water use will be controlled by soil moisture availability. In a premontane dry forest of southern Ecuador; tree water use patterns of four tree species of different phenologies were studied along an elevational gradient; in which soil moisture availability increases with altitude. Main interest was the influence of variation in soil moisture; vapor pressure deficit; species (representing phenology); elevation; and tree diameter on water use. Special emphasis was put on the stem succulent; deciduous Ceiba trichistandra; as high water use rates and drought coping involving stem succulence was to be expected. Tree water use rates increased linearly with diameter across species at high soil water content. However; when soil moisture declined; sap flux densities of the species responded differently. The stem succulent; deciduous Ceiba and other deciduous tree species reduced sap flux sensitively; whereas sap flux densities of the evergreen (broad leaved) Capparis scabrida were increasing. This was also reflected in diurnal hysteresis loops of sap flux vs. vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of the air. Under dry soil conditions; Ceiba and other deciduous tree species had much smaller areas in the hysteresis loop; whereas the area of Capparis was largely enhanced compared to wet conditions. The evergreen Capparis potentially had access to deeper soil water resources as water use patterns suggest that top soil drought was tolerated. The deciduous species followed a drought avoidance strategy by being leafless in the dry season. The stem succulent deciduous Ceiba flushed leaves at the end of the dry season before the rainy season began and also re-flushed early in the dry season after a rain event; however; water use rates at this occasion remained low. Ceiba was also ready for fast and strong response in water use when conditions were most favorable during the wet season. The study thus indicates a strong influence of species’ drought coping strategy on water use patterns in tropical dry forests.";"Ecología";"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00945/full";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Nevertheless; the forest is exposed to many threats linked with human activities. To understand the effects of these threats; which have not been appropriately assessed; we pose two questions: (a) What are the diversity and structural situations of the forest? (b) Are anthropogenic activities affecting the composition and structure of the forest? The assessed factors were species richness; diversity; species similarity; abundance; and density. Forest information was obtained from 72 plots (total area 25.92 ha) randomly placed to cover a wide range of stand densities (from 200 to 1100 m a.s.l.). After constructing linear mixed models and selecting the most influential one; we determined the individual influences of 12 predictors. The human pressure index (HPI) was the most negative predictor of forest health; and annual precipitation was the most important abiotic predictor of good health conditions. Livestock grazing did not significantly change the diversity and structure of mature forest. The mean annual temperature and stoniness influenced only the basal area and number of individuals; respectively. The species composition in our study area was not affected by the HPI; but was strongly predicted by annual precipitation.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.3390/f10010031";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Here we use individual species–area relationships (ISAR) to evaluate the spatial organization of tree diversity around
individuals of different species in a completely-mapped tropical dry forest in south Ecuador. We test two hypotheses. First;
stressful environmental conditions promote facilitative interactions that will generate spatial signals of accumulation of
diversity around individual trees – contrary to what has been reported in humid tropical forests. Second; spatial signals will
shift through ontogeny. As; as larger; older trees generate new microsite conditions that affect the recruitment of younger;
smaller trees.
We compute ISAR functions for adult trees; for young trees and a new crossed-ISAR function measuring the
accumulation of diversity of young trees around the old trees. We compare observed ISARs to the expectations of
inhomogeneous Poisson (i.e. null) models controlling for the effects of environmental variation and habitat association on
tree distribution.
Although the prevalent response among adult trees was not different from null expectations; which means that
the organization of diversity in this size class could be explained by environmental heterogeneity alone; most species accumulated more diversity than expected over short spatial scales in the small stem size class. Only two species accumulated
significant diversity in the crossed-ISARs. Our study indicates the role of facilitation in the organization of plant diversity
in this dry forest; but that facilitation is limited to some key species acting on early life stages and accumulating diversity
around them.
Our results demonstrate the benefit of considering different life-stages and crossed analyses to disentangle the processes
affecting community assembly in tropical dry forests.";"Ecología";"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ecog.01328";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

A test in a tropical dry forest";"NA";"Spatial patterns of adult plants are a consequence of several ecological processes related to seed dispersal and recruitment. Dispersal limitation; mediated by dispersal syndrome; is considered a key factor in the formation of adult plant spatial patterns. Although this initial pattern determined by dispersal has been thoroughly studied; the subsequently modification by the effect of additional ecological factors; such as habitat heterogeneity is less understood. We explored the relative importance of dispersal syndrome and spatial heterogeneity on the realization of spatial patterns of adult trees in an Ecuadorian tropical dry forest. The spatial distribution of 28 species was modeled with four different spatial point processes each: homogeneous Poisson (HPP); inhomogeneous Poisson (IPP); homogeneous Poisson cluster (HPCP); and inhomogeneous Poisson cluster process (IPCP). These models allowed us to discern between effects of random processes; habitat heterogeneity; limited dispersal; and joint effects of habitat heterogeneity and limited dispersal. We employed Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the model which best fit the spatial pattern of each species. The best model of each species was used to analyze differences in cluster size and degree of aggregation; between dispersal syndromes. Seventy-five percent of the species showed inhomogeneous patterns. IPCP yielded the best fit for the spatial distribution of 50% of species in the studied forest and was the prevalent model for the three dispersal syndromes. Thus; the effect of spatial heterogeneity was prevalent in the distribution of most species in this dry tropical forest. Only 21% of species had spatial patterns compatible with random mechanisms associated to limited dispersal around parent sources. Clearly; ignoring habitat heterogeneity could bias the analysis of relationships between dispersal syndrome and species patterns.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.02098";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Such knowledge can be the result of scientific investigation; but important insight can also reside in observant local land managers. In seasonally dry tropical forests in southern Ecuador; recent decades have seen important advances in the knowledge of the biodiversity values of these forests; but the available data have not yet been integrated and translated into tools that support managers in deciding restoration measures. One powerful framework to organize and communicate information about ecosystem degradation and recovery dynamics is the state-transition model. We generated such a model by combining ecologist and local knowledge obtained through an adaptation of the Stanford/SRI expert elicitation protocol. Through this information; we identified five forest states with specific attributes of vegetation; human pressures; and restoration needs. Ecologists and locals agreed on the restoration actions but partially disagreed on the causes of degradation. Whereas ecologists considered that grazing management; often introduced with or after logging; was the catalyst for a transition to degraded states; locals attributed those transitions to the effects of logging alone. Importantly; however; both ecologists and locals considered that exclusion of livestock grazing was a necessary action to promote ecological recovery. A forward-looking strategy focusing on objectives for ecosystem recovery and ecosystem management for biodiversity and human well-being might be more successful than strategies that emphasize or seek to attribute responsibility for degradation.";"Ecología";"https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss4/art22/";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Peru";"Bosques secos"

The extensive seasonally dry forest formations in the Ecuadorean and Peruvian lowlands and hills (i.e.; forests below 500 m altitude) were comparatively much more species poor.

The characteristic ENSO frequency band is reflected in wavelet power spectra of both chronologies. Both species show a strong correlation between ring width and precipitation of the wet season (January–May). Strong El Niño events (1972; 1983 and 1998) lead to strong growth responses in the tree-ring chronologies; whereas ‘normal’ ENSO events do not trigger long-lasting growth responses. The first ring-width based wet-season precipitation reconstruction for the past 103 years was developed.

evaluated. Hydro-climatic variables; like precipitation and
relative humidity; were the most important factors for
controlling tree growth. Changes in rainwater input affected radial increment rates and daily amplitudes of stem

the two extreme years 2009 (wet) and 2011 (dry). Contrary

which play a major role in the functioning of the forests. Lichens constitute an important
fraction of the epiphytes. These poikilohydric organisms respond drastically to disturbance;
which is strongly linked to humidity and light availability. We hypothesized that richness
and species composition of lichens would be related to diferences in forest structure (e.g.;
canopy openness) promoted by deforestation; and by host tree characteristics; due to the
fact that dry forests generally have poor microclimatic stratifcation and low diversity of
tree species. In this study; we assessed the richness and composition of epiphytic lichens
on the trunks of 513 trees in undisturbed and disturbed dry forests of southern Ecuador.
Both lichen composition and richness were highly correlated with tree species and host tree
traits such as bark structure and tree diameter. Additionally; epiphytic lichen diversity was
related to canopy cover and tree richness at diferent disturbance levels. We conclude that
epiphytic lichen communities in seasonal dry tropical forests of Ecuador are mainly limited
by host tree traits and tree species. Loss of epiphytic lichen species in the studied forests
is particularly due to loss of host trees such as Cochlospermum vitifolium and Eriotheca

still lacking. However; such information is needed to better manage these forests; which have been severely disturbed by anthropogenic use and are also threatened by
climate warming. To cover this research gap; we evaluated
intra-annual variations in stem diameter and assessed cambial growth dynamics in five tree species of a Tumbesian
tropical dry forest located in southern Ecuador. Using data
from band dendrometers over a 5-year period; we modeled
seasonal variations in stem increments through generalized additive mixed models. Monthly radial increments and
annual growth rates were also correlated with monthly climatic variables (mean; maximum and minimum temperature; and total rainfall). Stem increments and xylem growth
were clearly coupled with rainfall seasonality; although
temperature effects were also detected. Interestingly; annual
growth in all species did not respond similarly to climate;
despite having similar growth rates and intra-annual growth
patterns";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00468-017-1530-x";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

their secondary growth? And in their growth rates between consecutive years? If so;
how are these contrasting patterns linked to seasonality in climatic variables (temperature; precipitation)? Which is the role of leaf phenology and functional traits as
drivers of stem radial increment responses to climate?
Location: A Tumbesian tropical dry forest in southern Ecuador.
Methods: We used a 12-year database of stem radial increments to characterize
intra- and inter-annual patterns of secondary growth in 13 co-existing dominant tree
species. For each species; we adjusted an additive model to describe intra-annual
increment patterns and created a mean series of annual increments to describe interannual changes. Adjusted increments were then correlated with monthly temperature and rainfall data over the study period; and also with the crown percentage
covered by leaves. The role of functional traits (leaf area; wood density; maximum
tree height; seed dry mass) was explored using average trait values per species.
Results: We observed continuous variation in the seasonality of radial increments;
ranging from species that started incrementing their diameter as early as first rains
occurred in the season to species that showed delayed responses. Variability in intraand inter-annual increment patterns was explained by functional traits (leaf area and
seed dry mass; and maximum height and wood density; respectively) and leaf phenology; but this variation was not clearly matched with any functional trait configuration. This; combined with the absence of homogeneous responses of annual growth
rates to climate; suggests the existence of contrasting strategies that virtually vary in
a species-specific fashion.
Conclusions: Co-existing tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests show different growth strategies to face intra- and inter-annual climate variations; which may
increase the resilience of these forests against projected climatic variations.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12840";"Artículo";"Eastern Cordillera real montane forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

However; despite their importance; these ecosystems are the least studied and have been impacted by human activity in the last decades. Moreover; future projections show an additional impact caused by climate change. For this reason; the understanding of anthropogenic and climate change impacts will help to improve adaptation strategies for a better species conservation. Consequently; we analyzed the impact of climate change and stressors on species distribution from dry forest ecosystem in southern Ecuador. We identified the variables that could help to buffer the potential impacts. Indicator species of climate change impacts were chosen using a species selection index considering an importance index value; density; rarity and altitudinal range. The selected species were Cavanillesia platanifolia; Cordia macrantha (C. macrantha); Erythrina velutina; Handroanthus chrysanthus (H. chrysanthus) and Terminalia valverdeae (T. valverdeae). Species current and future distribution models were generated with information from Herbarium ‘Reinaldo Espinosa’ of the National University of Loja and permanent plots that were established between 2005 and 2009. We used climate data from WorldClim under two climate change scenarios based on two IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. To know if the species distribution will be placed in regions with high sensitivity or adaptive capacity; 13 stressor variables and 3 buffers were selected. The sensitivity and adaptive capacity maps were intersected with species future distribution models under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. Four of five species in the analysis showed a reduction in their future distribution: C. macrantha; T. valverdeae and H. chrysanthus. These were reduced due to increasing niche restriction. Between 18 and 26% of species future distribution area were located in zones with high sensitivity. In addition; among 14% to 46% of species future distribution area could be in sites with high adaptive capacity. In these areas; conservation strategies can serve as buffers against climate change; however; nowadays there is a conservation gap that needs to be addressed through the implementation of different strategies oriented to reinforce the adaptive capacity of these species in dry forest ecosystems. Species distribution models showed no migration to higher altitudes; but we observed a reduction in areas with high probability of presence. Additionally; sites with high likelihood of species presence have been influenced by deforestation; fragmentation; land use and other stressors; that will likely diminish their ability to adapt to climate warming and increased rainfall variability.";"Ecología";"https://doi.org/10.1080/23766808.2016.1258867";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

";"This research explores the perspective of social actors about the ecosystem services (ES)
provided by tropical dry forests (TDF) in two protected areas in southern Ecuador that
differ in their management schemes. Identifying the ES and understanding the preferences of local communities is seen as a means for improving decision making; especially in
the protected areas. Therefore; our goal was to apply social assessment tools in order to
have an in depth appreciation of the factors influencing the perception of social actors in a
comparative case study. Since the research was conducted in two areas with similar
ecosystem; but with different management; it illustrates the potential role that management policies have at shaping the perception of social actors regarding TDF’s ecosystem
services. The results suggest that people perceive and prioritize ecosystem services differently according to the area and that such perception and prioritization is influenced not
only by the management processes but also by the role that social actors play in the
protected area.";"Ecología";"http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75081";"Artículo";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Uno de los factores de mayor importancia que conllevan a la necesidad de la conservación de las áreas de bosque seco es el desarrollo excepcional de la diversidad biológica que allí se presenta. La composición florística de estas zonas presentan comportamientos de adaptación a condiciones que podrían considerarse extremas en las que se da un desarrollo importante de la vegetación en condiciones de muy poca disponibilidad de agua; lo que produce la presencia de gran cantidad de especies endémicas.

understanding of the mechanisms that affect growth and survival of tree seedling in this
environment of high levels of sunlight; low levels of soil nutrients; and water stress. The
neotropical tree species; Bursera graveolens; is adapted to arid; nutrient poor conditions. It is also logged for its aromatic and resinous wood. Its use in restoration projects has been limited by the difficulty of producing planting stock. The objectives of this study were to (1) increase seed germination rates via pretreatments so that nursery managers can produce more planting stock; and (2) quantify physiological responses to drought so that land managers can determine appropriate planting sites and estimate future growth. In this two part study; we determined seed germination under several pretreatments such as sanding; soaking in hot water and acid; and measured drought impacts on biomass allocation; photosynthesis; and plant water relations. The results indicated that none of the treatments had any significant effect on seed germination. The passage of a six to eight month dormancy period equal to the length of the dry season in the tree’s habitat was also hypothesized to improve seed germination. It is not. However; it appears that a minimum of 2 months of dry after - ripening; are needed for an acceptable seed germination rate of 25%. Water stressed seedlings (at 2% soil water content) maintained similar 10 levels of photosynthesis to well-watered seedlings (at 19% soil water content) demonstrating drought tolerance of the species. The information generated will enable natural resource professionals to produce more planting stock and guarantee successful field planting. The next logical step for further research would be to examine the physiological responses to drought of plants growing under tropical field conditions.";NA;"http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0041327/morgan_m.pdf";NA;"Western Ecuador moist forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques lluviosos"

Sin embargo; para los bosques tropicales estacionalmente secos los estudios relacionados con este proceso son aun escasos y dispersos en comparacion con los bosques tropicales lluviosos. En este trabajo se estudio la importancia de los sindromes de dispersion de semillas en la estructuracion de comunidades; mediante el analisis de los patrones de dispersion de semillas en el espacio y tiempo para comunidades de lenosas en los bosques secos del suroccidente Ecuatoriano. Esta area forma parte de la region Tumbesina; una de las areas de endemismo mas importantes del mundo; pero tambien uno de los hotspots mas amenazados. El clima se caracteriza por una estacion seca que va de mayo a noviembre y una estacion lluviosa que se extiende desde diciembre a abril. Para toda esta zona se estima una temperatura promedio anual entre 20° y 26°C y una precipitacion promedio anual entre 300 y 700 mm. El trabajo de campo se desarrollo entre febrero de 2009 y septiembre de 2012. El primer paso fue la recopilacion de informacion sobre las especies lenosas nativas de los bosques secos del suroccidente de Ecuador; que permitiera asignar a cada especie a un sindrome de dispersion para determinar el espectro de sindromes de dispersion de semillas. Luego; utilizando la informacion disponible de 109 parcelas establecidas previamente a lo largo de cuatro cantones de la provincia de Loja que conservan bosques secos en buen estado; se analizo la relacion entre el sindrome de dispersion y condiciones ambientales. La relacion de los sindromes de dispersion con los patrones espaciales de las especies y con los patrones de la lluvia y banco de semillas se estudio dentro de una parcela permanente de 9 ha; en la Reserva Ecologica Arenillas. Dentro de esta parcela se establecio un transecto de aproximadamente 3;4 km; que se recorrio mensualmente para colectar excretas de cervidos y analizar el rol de este grupo como dispersor de semillas. Una gran variedad de plantas en los bosques secos tropicales del suroccidente de Ecuador requirio la asistencia de animales para la dispersion de semillas. Sin embargo; un analisis del espectro de dispersion considerando no solo la riqueza; sino tambien la abundancia relativa de especies; permitio determinar que a pesar de la alta variedad de especies zoocoras; la mayor parte de la comunidad correspondia a individuos anemocoros; que no proveen ninguna recompensa para la dispersion por animales. Este patron puede deberse a la abundancia relativa de habitats adecuados para especies con diferente sindrome de dispersion. Las condiciones ambientales afectaron la estructura del espectro de dispersion en la comunidad de bosque seco neotropical estudiada. El analisis de la importancia relativa del sindrome de dispersion y de la heterogeneidad espacial en la formacion de patrones espaciales de arboles adultos permitio determinar que la heterogeneidad ambiental ejercia un efecto adicional (y en algunos el unico) en la formacion de patrones agregados de la mayoria de especies estudiadas. Los resultados senalaron diferencias en los patrones espaciales de las especies dependiendo del sindrome de dispersion; pero tambien una gran variacion en los patrones espaciales incluso entre especies del mismo sindrome de dispersion. El analisis simultaneo de los patrones de la lluvia de semillas y banco de semillas de una comunidad de lenosas y su relacion con la vegetacion establecida indicaron que la lluvia de semillas era temporalmente variable en numero de especies y abundancia de semillas; y dependia del sindrome de dispersion. El sindrome de dispersion tambien influyo en la formacion de bancos de semillas; siendo las especies con capacidad de dispersion limitada (autocoras) las de mayor riqueza de especies y abundancia de semillas. Los cervidos tambien se consideraron como un elemento clave en el proceso de dispersion de semillas. Al menos ocho especies lenosas fueron dispersadas legitimamente via endozoocora. La mayoria de las especies dispersadas presentaron diasporas sin adaptaciones obvias para la dispersion; por lo que la ingestion de semillas por cervidos se constituye en una via potencial para la dispersion de sus semillas a largas distancias y; con ello; mejora la posibilidad de colonizar nuevos sitios y mantener el flujo genetico. Los resultados de este estudio aportan nuevas evidencias para el entendimiento de la importancia de los procesos de dispersion de semillas en la estructura de los bosques secos neotropicales. Uno de los principales hallazgos a partir de estos cuatro capitulos es que los patrones espaciales de las especies; asi como las estrategias que utilizan para dispersarse y hacer frente a las condiciones adversas (es decir; lluvia o banco de semillas) llevan consigo un efecto del sindrome de dispersion; y que la intensidad ese efecto depende a la vez de las condiciones ambientales del lugar. ABSTRACT The importance of seed dispersal process in the estructuring and ecosystem dynamic is widely recongnized. However; for seasonally tropical dry forest studies related to this process are still scarce and scattered compared to tropical rain forests. The present research deals with the importance of seed dispersal syndromes as a driver in the community structure; focusing its attention to temporal and spatial patterns of seed dispersal in woody communities of seasonally dry forest at Southwestern Ecuador. This area is part of the Tumbesian region; one of the most important areas of endemism; but also one of the most threatened areas around the world. Climate is characterized by a dry season from May to November; and a rainy season from December to April. For the whole area an average temperature between 20 ° and 26 ° C; and an average annual rainfall between 300 and 700 mm are estimated. Fieldwork was carried out between February 2009 and September 2012. During a first step information about native woody species of dry forests of southwestern Ecuador was gathered; enabling to assign a dispersal syndrome to each species to determine the seed dispersal spectrum. In a second step; available information from 109 established plots along four municipalities in Loja province; which hold the highest and best conserved dry forest remanants; was analyzed to establish the relationship between dispersal syndromes and environmental conditions. The relationships between dispersal syndromes and species spatial patterns; and between dispersal syndromes and seed rain and seed bank patterns; were studied within a permanent plot of 9 ha; in the Arenillas Ecological Reserve. Within this plot one transect of approximately 3.4 km was set to collect monthly deer droppings; which were used to latter analyze the rol of this group as seed dispersers. The results showed that a large variety of plants in tropical dry forest of Southwestern Ecuador require animal assistance to dispers their seeds. However; an analysis of seed dispersal spectrum considering not only species richness; but also the relative abundance of species; allowed to determine that despite the high variety of zoochorous species; most individuals in the community corresponds to anemochoruos species. This shift may be due to the relative abundance of habitats that are suitable for species with different dispersal syndromes. Moreover; quantitative data analysis showed that environmental conditions affect the structure of seed dispersal spectrum in the studied community. The analysis of relative importance of dispersal syndrome; and the environmental heterogeneity on formation of adult trees spatial patterns; indicated that environmental heterogeneity exert an additional (or was the only) effect limiting the distribution of most species in this forest. The findings showed differences in spatial patterns related to dispersal syndrome; but also showed a large variation in spatial patterns even among species sharing the same dispersal syndrome. Simultaneous analysis of seed rain and seed bank patterns of a woody community; and their relationship with established vegetation; suggested that seed rain is temporally variable in species number and seeds abundance; and that variation is related to the dispersal syndrome. Dispersal syndrome also influenced on the formation of seed banks; being species with limited dispersal abilities (autochorous) the ones with highest species richness and seed abundance. Deer were found as a key element in the seed dispersal process. At least to eight woody species were dispersed legitimately by ingestion. Diaspores of most dispersed species had no obvious adaptations to seed dispersal; therefore; seed ingestion by deer represents a potential pathway for long-distance dispersal; and hence; improves the chances to colonizing new sites and to maintain gene flow. Overall; these results provide new evidence for understanding the importance of seed dispersal processes in the structure of Neotropical dry forests. One of the major findings from these four chapters is that spatial patterns of species; and the strategies used to disperse their seeds and to deal with the adverse conditions (i.e. seed rain or seed bank) are related with dispersal syndromes; and the intensity of that relation depends in turn; on environmental conditions.";"Ecología";"http://oa.upm.es/35054/1/ANDREA_KATHERINE_JARA_GUERRERO.pdf";"tesis";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

regeneración; la estructura y composición de los bosques tropicales. La identificación de
dichos disturbios permite establecer directrices para la conservación de estos bosques. El
objetivo de éste trabajo es determinar los efectos de las perturbaciones sobre la estructura
del bosque seco tropical en los sitios La Naranja; La Bomba y La Poza de la parroquia
Membrillal. Se realizó un muestreo aleatorio estratificado. Se establecieron 18 parcelas de
0;1 ha (50 m x 20 m) siguiendo la Metodología de Inventario Rápido. Se realizó un análisis
de correlación canónico y se identificaron especies indicadoras (claves; promisorias y
vulnerables). En las áreas estudiadas se encontraron 76 especies y 2 387 individuos donde
las más representativas son: Guarea purusana C. DC; Handroanthus billbergii (A. H.
Gentry) S. O.Grose; Croton trinitatis Millsp; Guarea kunthiana A. Juss; Cordia macrantha
Chod y Bunchosia cauliflora W. R. Anderson. La familia con mayor número de especies es
la Fabaceae; teniendo una diversidad alta en el sector objeto de estudio. La curva área
especie demostró que con un muestreo de 18 parcelas es suficiente para representar la
comunidad estudiada Entre las perturbaciones identificadas a priori pueden mencionarse; la
tala selectiva; la extracción de productos forestales no maderables y la construcción de
caminos. Se demostró que dichas perturbaciones han modificado la composición de
especies; la dominancia; la abundancia y el área basal.

Diversidad";"El bosque seco tropical es un ecosistema frágil que está en constante amenaza debido a las diversas actividades antrópicas que progresan con un control insuficiente. Por esta razón; En este trabajo se planteó analizar cobertura arbórea y suelo del bosque seco tropical en el sector Quimís de la comuna Sancán Los datos se obtuvieron clasificando los estratos: arbóreo; alto; bajo y brinzal; estableciendo seis parcelas anidadas de 50 x 20m. Se identificaron 12 familias; 22 géneros y 22 especies; con un total de 241 individuos. El comportamiento de la diversidad fue medio-alto; según el índice de Shannon; mientras que el índice de Simpson muestra una alta dominancia (0;91). Las familias más representativas fueron: Fabaceae; Euphorbiaceae y Capparaceae. En el caso de la especie; los más representativos en términos de IVIE fueron: Bursera graveolens (Kunth) Triana ; Planch; Geoffroea spinosa Jacq; Cordia lutea Lam. Por otro lado; las clases diametrales mostraron una forma de ""J"" invertida que indica una concentración mayoritaria de individuos jóvenes en la primera clasificación (0-10 cm). El suelo se asemeja al tipo Inceptisol ya que tiene un pH entre prácticamente neutro a neutro; además de una textura arcillosa y Franco - Arcilla - Arenoso; con una cantidad media-baja de materia orgánica; estos suelos se caracterizan por su alta fertilidad; ya que tienen porcentajes equilibrados y una disponibilidad de los elementos químicos primarios y secundarios.";"Diversidad";"http://repositorio.unesum.edu.ec/handle/53000/2226";"tesis";"Ecuadorian dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Algunas especies características son el palo santo; ceibo y matorrales espinosos. La temperatura es un factor decisivo dentro del ciclo de vida de las plantas; manipulando y adquiriendo conocimiento de este proceso se tiene la posibilidad de reproducir y rescatar inclusive especies que estén amenazadas o en estado de vulnerabilidad actualmente; por diversos factores. En esta investigación se evaluó la germinación de semillas de siete especies forestales de bosque seco tropical de la provincia de Manabí; a las cuales se aplicaron tres niveles de temperatura: 26.8; 32.5 y 29.7 °C bajo condiciones in-vitro; sin la aplicación de tratamientos pregerminativos; con cuatro repeticiones cada temperatura por especie. En el Análisis de Varianza (ANOVA) y comparación de medias mediante pruebas de Tukey se encontraron diferencias altamente significativas para las medias de germinación en cada una de las especies en estudio; las temperaturas que obtuvieron el mayor promedio de germinación según el análisis estadístico fueron 26.8 y 32.7 °C. Cedrela odorata al igual que Albizia saman presentaron mayor porcentaje de germinación a 26.8 °C; mientras que para Albizia guachapele fue a 32.5 °C; Ceiba trichistandra por el contrario presento mayor porcentaje a 29.7 °C; las especies restantes no presentaron germinación relevante. La información obtenida en este estudio puede ser utilizada para la aplicación de tratamientos germinativos combinados con diversos niveles de temperatura para plantear programas de restauración; manejo y propagación de especies nativas de bosque seco tropical. Palabras Claves: semillas; germinación; restauración; propagación.";"Conservación";"http://repositorio.uteq.edu.ec/handle/43000/3759";"tesis";"South American Pacific mangroves";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"

Se establecen 43 puntos de muestreo para la flora en un área total de 20.500 m2. Para la fauna se elabora 75 transectos de 1 km cada uno; distribuidos desde el Manglar hasta el Bosque Seco en un rango altitudinal de 6 a 110 metros. La data de la flora se procesa con análisis de conglomerados; porcentaje de similitud (SIMPER) con el índice de Bray-Curtis; análisis de escalamiento multidimensional no métrico (MDS) y la fotointerpretación de imagen satelital Lansat 2016 en QGIS 2.2 y ARCGIS 10.2. Se integran inventarios existentes de flora y fauna a la información obtenida. La flora vascular está conformada por 291 especies en 64 familias; 114 son registros nuevos para la Reserva Arenillas. Fabaceae con 39 especies es la familia más diversa. La fauna tiene 468 especies (134 macroinvertebrados y 334 vertebrados); las clases más diversas son insecta (125) y aves (213). Se diferenciaron cinco zonas: Bosque de Manglar y Salinas; Espinar Litoral; Bosque Seco de Conchales; Bosque Seco de Planicie y Bosque Seco de Colinas. Se reporta por primera vez; el Bosque Seco de Conchales dentro del Manglar. Aunque estos bosques están en un área protegida; resisten a la fuerte presión de la acuicultura y agricultura. La redefinición de sus límites causa deforestación; generando más fragmentación y reducción de bosques que aún sostienen el 69% de las aves endémicas de la región Tumbesina y son el único refugio de la fauna residente y migratoria. Estos resultados deben incluirse en la actualización del plan de manejo de esta Reserva; pues es urgente priorizar la conservación de sus áreas más vulnerables y asegurar la sobrevivencia de uno de los pocos remanentes de Bosque Seco y Manglar en el sur oeste del Ecuador; en el núcleo Pacífico Ecuatorial y la región Tumbesina.";"Ecología";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12672/7271";"Tesis";"Tumbes-Piura dry forests";"Ecuador";"Bosques secos"
